We are excited to announce the Summer 2024 Palaeoverse Lecture Series focused on software development and methodological approaches in palaeontology. The aim of this lecture series is to promote the use of new tools in the field and to give researchers a platform to showcase their work. The format is intended to be flexible but will generally include a short seminar followed by a demonstration of the speaker's software toolkit and/or method and will conclude with a group discussion.

**Lectures will be held on the last Thursday of each month from 18:00--19:00 UTC (14:00 EDT).**

This semester, we will be joined by the following four speakers:

**June 27^th^ 2024 - Dr April Wright, Southeastern Louisiana University**  
Models, Meaning, and the Middle Cambrian

**July 25^th^ 2024 - Dr Gawain Antell, University of California**  
Spatially standardized subsampling for fair comparisons and meaningful characterisations of ecological metrics through time

**August 29^th^ 2024 - Dr Rafaela Missagia, Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo**  
Advancing morphological research with computed tomography: a case study on predatory rodents

**September 26^th^ 2024 - Dr Euan Furness, University of Cambridge**  
Reproducing emergent eco-evolutionary patterns from a first-principles agent-based model

Please register below for the series. All are welcome to join and we ask that all participants abide by the [**Palaeoverse Code of Conduct**](conduct.qmd).
