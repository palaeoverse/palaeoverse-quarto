# R for Palaeobiologists: Workshop and Hackathon

**Location:** University College London

**Date:** 9--10^th^ September 2023

::: justify

R is one of the most popular languages in the world of Data Science and has been widely adopted by  the palaeobiology community to clean, analyse and plot data. General familiarity with R allows users to expand the potential of their research and automate routine tasks. Importantly, it allows researchers to improve the reproducibility of their research and document their analyses. The workshop component of this event will provide an introduction to databases (e.g. Paleobiology Database), building workflows in R (e.g. data cleaning), developing functions, and the versatility R has to offer. The hackathon component of this event will provide the opportunity for researchers to work together in small focus groups to develop workflows, functions and novel tools to address challenges in palaeobiology. This event will provide a great opportunity for attendees to work with different researchers and gain experience working collaboratively in R to generate reproducible research.
