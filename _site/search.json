As of this past February, the old API had been discontinued, resulting in the rphylopic package becoming effectively defunct. Fortunately, Palaeoverse quickly expressed interest in helping getting the package back on its feet, and it has now been transferred to the Palaeoverse community for future maintenance! William Gearty is the new maintainer and Lewis Jones has been helping to get the package back to working order.\n\n\n\nrphylopic version 1.0.0 now available\nAs part of our new maintenance of the package, we updated the existing functions to work with the new API and also reworked nearly all of the core functionality of fetching and plotting silhouettes.

General familiarity with R allows users to expand the potential of their research and automate routine tasks. Importantly, it allows researchers to improve the reproducibility of their research and document their analyses. The workshop component of this event will provide an introduction to databases (e.g. Paleobiology Database), building workflows in R (e.g. data cleaning), developing functions, and the versatility R has to offer. The hackathon component of this event will provide the opportunity for researchers to work together in small focus groups to develop workflows, functions and novel tools to address challenges in palaeobiology. This event will provide a great opportunity for attendees to work with different researchers and gain experience working collaboratively in R to generate reproducible research."
